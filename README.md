# Analyzing Unicorn Companies
 Analyzing trends in high-growth companies in the United States between the years 2019-2021. 

## Project Description
Which industries are booming? Where should your next investment be? With the rise of the ‘amateur investor’ and the availability of platforms enabling people to invest and sell stock in public companies, it’s never been a better time to understand the financial performance of companies across the globe!

Using a PostgreSQL database you’ll be able to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion! You’ll find out which industries have the highest average valuation and then zoom in on these to determine how many new unicorns have been produced annually between 2019 and 2021! This is the datacamp link to the [project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/1531).
